papercut bugs:
	- blank json instances appear for private/deleted posts which should otherwise not appear at all
	- random nature of id generation may overwrite existing entities 
	- user can change own id
	- anything can be written without validation during 'put'
	- no concept of page followers
	- searching for wrong pages/profiles gives an http error
	
TEST CASES:
	- User cannot post using someone else's id
	- User cannot post to page if not an admin
	-

- make golang execute shell script
